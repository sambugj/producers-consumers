Implementations in a  C# Console app for the purpose of learning how to solve this problem step by step using lock to ensure the mutual exclusion to access in the critical region.

We have implementations with issues to see the differences with the thread safe implementation.

Running the bad implementations we can see different errors with the same program and that is typically a behaviour of the program with concurrency problems.
